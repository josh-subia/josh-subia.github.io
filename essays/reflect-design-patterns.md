Despite my 4+ years of experience dealing with college assignments and problems, it never ceases to amaze me how many times I spent way much time trying to solve a problem that could have been solved rather quickly or even avoided completely. After about an hour or so trying to solve such a simple problem, I feel like doing something like the gif on the left. All of these troubles and pains could have been avoided if I had utilized a design pattern, which are typical solutions to common problems. Design patterns helps prevent subtle issues early in the development stage so that they do not become a much larger problem later. Patterns are often confused with algorithms, which gives precise steps to achieve an objective, while patterns are more like a blueprint, where you can only see the end result and what some of its components are, but are without steps, as its implementation is up to you to decide.
