## My Life Could Have Been So Much Easier

Despite my 4+ years of experience dealing with college assignments and problems, it never ceases to amaze me how many times I spent way much time trying to solve a problem that could have been solved rather quickly or even avoided completely. After about an hour or so trying to solve such a simple problem, I feel like doing something like the gif on the left. All of these troubles and pains could have been avoided if I had utilized a design pattern, which are typical solutions to common problems. Design patterns helps prevent subtle issues early in the development stage so that they do not become a much larger problem later. Patterns are often confused with algorithms, which gives precise steps to achieve an objective, while patterns are more like a blueprint, where you can only see the end result and what some of its components are, but are without steps, as its implementation is up to you to decide.

## Different Design Patterns
The concept of patterns was first described by Christopher Alexander in his book "A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction.", describing patterns as a "language" for designing an urban environment. This concept was picked up by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm, who then published a book in 1994 called "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", where the concept of patterns was applied to software engineering. Currently, design patterns are classified into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. 

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object instantiation, specifically trying to create objects that are suitable for the current system. Creational design patterns control object creation by utilizing the following components: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype, and Singleton. An abstract factor creates an instance of several families of classes. The builder separates object construction from its representation. Factory method creates an instance of several derived classes. The object pool recycles objects that are no longer in use. Prototypes are the fully initialized instance which are to be copied or clones. A singleton is a class where only a single instance of it can exist. 

Structural design patterns ease the design of systems by identifying a simple way to instantiate relationships between entities, and utilizes the following components: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and a Proxy. The adapter matches interfaces of different classes. The bridge separates an object's interface from its implementation. A composite is a tree structure of simple and composite objects. A decorator is responsible for adding responsibilities to objects dynamically. A facade is a single class that represents an entire subsystem. A flyweight is a fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing. The private class data restricts accessor/mutator acces and a proxy acts as an object representing another object.
