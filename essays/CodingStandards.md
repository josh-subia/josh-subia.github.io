## Poor Code Written Well vs Good Code Written Poorly
It has been more than three years since I first began coding. My first line of code was written in C, and while I was excited to begin coding, it came with all of the trials and tribulations of learning a new language. One thing I learned over the years that has not been taught to me until now, is coding standards, which ensures proper grammer for a programming language. Consider a paragraph of a story written in English. Even if all the words were spelled correctly and the words themselves make sense, if proper grammer is not present, then it is hard to understand. The same logic can be applied to programming as well.

Using ESLint with IntelliJ IDEA has been a godsent compared to previous IDE's that I have used. Its ability to detect and automatically correct warnings and errors before compilation has made it much more easier to program since you don't have to worry about these yourself.
